MyPaint was my final (extra credit) project for advanced Java class at City College of San Francisco.

Main purpose of this project is to create simple simulation of drawing software. 
In this project I focused on several main things: 
1. Drawing itself 
2. Selecting Color 
3. Selecting right size 
4. Bug tracking 
5. Possible monetization (via moving banner)
6. User experience
7. Simplicity

I was given 2 weeks to finish this project and I made it in about 9-10 days.
In this project you I made custom Color Selector, Brush Selector, and Size Chooser.
Also, moving panel at the top was my idea of possible usage of space for ads.

As a main challenge for this project our proffesor set us a requrement to save images we need to use Object Serialization.
That's why all images saved in byte code, however it can be easily changed.

Wrapping it all up, I want to say that it was challenging and very interesting project that helped me to understand Java better.
